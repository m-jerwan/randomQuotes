"# randomQuotes"

website to randomly display couple (5) quotes.

aesthetic and functional features: will try to make 5 panels which are half blocked [darker and with logo, explaining what the quote is about, ex. sports] and small in size.
After hover, the full quote will show with [would be good] author in the background.
[link to quotes website for credit?]

darker image as img
authors face as background
quote itself- will try as <p>, but might be forced to photoshop onto background. [no difference to functionality, just a bigger pain if want to add more quotes.]

jS engine to generate randoms not even touched.
